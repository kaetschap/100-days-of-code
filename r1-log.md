# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - kaetschap

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 16, Saturday, 2017].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started working on the "CatPhotoApp" by freeCodeCamp.

### R1D2
Finished working on the "CatPhotoApp" by freeCodeCamp. Started building a tribute page at https://codepen.io/Kaetschap/pen/veNjjZ.

### R1D3
Continued building the tribute page. Added content and gray area in the middle, with rounded edges.

### R1D4
Focused on trying out the decorator pattern. Learned about the difference between abstract classes and interfaces: Abstract classes can inherit their non-abstract classes to the classes implementing them whereas interface methods are not allowed a method body. Thus, each method needs to be implemented in the class implementing the interface. This is disadvantageous if one method stays the same across all subclasses implementing it.

### R1D5
Made myself a hackerrank profile and completed the first challenge: Array Left Rotation https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-array-left-rotation/submissions/code/54915195

### R1D6
Learned about closures in javascript; Looked at example decorator pattern from "Head First: Design Patterns".

### R1D7
Started matrix excercise on exercism. Got most working, but it's not very elegant and there are some special cases left to consider.

### R1D8
Started doing the freeCodeCamp backend intro with how-to-npm. It won't publish the package.
